# polygon
Polygons generator

Given n arbistrary points in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space, we want to know the total number of simple polygons without actually obtaining them.
Alternatively, we will also obtain them as a means to test our approach.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_polygon for info on what a simple polygon is.


We use Graph theory and simple topology/geometry analysis.
